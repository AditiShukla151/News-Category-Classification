# News Category Classification using Naive Bayes

This project involves developing a machine learning model to automatically classify news articles into predefined categories using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The automated system significantly reduces the time and labor required for manual categorization and achieves a high accuracy rate.

## Project Overview
Manual categorization of news articles is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This project leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm to automate the classification process, achieving an accuracy of over 96%, which is a substantial improvement over traditional methods.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Classification**: Reduces the manual effort required for categorizing news articles by 90%.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy rate of over 96%.
- **Efficiency**: Speeds up the classification process significantly, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or above
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled news articles with predefined categories. It is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure optimal performance of the Naive Bayes classifier.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and tokenize text data.
   - Convert text to numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the preprocessed dataset.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Classify new, unseen news articles into their respective categories.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd news-category-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Test the model with sample inputs to see the classification results.

## Results
The Naive Bayes classifier achieved:
- **Accuracy**: 96%+
- Significant reduction in time and labor for news categorization.

## Future Scope
- Integrate additional preprocessing techniques to handle more complex datasets.
- Explore other machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Neural Networks for further performance improvement.
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time classification.
